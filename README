Simple application with following features:

Authentication:
  - register()
  - loging()
  - logout() [unimplemented atm]
  
Data storage:
  - sendText()
  - sendNumber()
  
Interesting are the use of Volley and a JobManager which allows to send messages even when offline
as well as ensuring in order delivery and resend when the network connection is available again.
